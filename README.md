# -IOT-sec-task
this task includes connecting two controllers using UART----"2 Arduino"
  So that the transmission of signals between  2 Arduinos will be  clarified 
   ,after running the code and clicking on the button,
  the signal will be transferred from Arduino 1 to Arduino 2 and the red LED will be turned on.
  the results are  :
